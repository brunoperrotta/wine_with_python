# [Wine with Python](https://brunoperrotta-wine-with-python-wine-python-upo12n.streamlit.app/)

I explored the incredible possibilities of the Python library called Streamlit. This tool allows the transformation of a simple data script into an interactive web application, all with just Python.

The project titled "Analysis of Brazilian Table Wine Imports" delves into the intricate economic landscape of wine import trends in Brazil, covering the period from 1970 to 2022. By examining the accumulated value of the top five wine exporters to Brazil during this period, the study reveals a significant increase in import volume and the rise of key leaders in table wines in the 1990s, coinciding with Brazil's economic liberalization and the creation of Mercosur. This suggests that dynamic patterns shape consumption preferences, constantly evolving in this category in our country.

Additionally, the study tracks the annual values of table wines imported by Brazil over the specified period, providing insights into consumption trends and market fluctuations. A crucial aspect of the analysis involves mapping the evolution of the top five countries exporting wine to Brazil over time, shedding light on diplomatic, economic, and cultural dynamics influencing this trade relationship. This project serves not only to inform those interested in the wine industry but also to stimulate discussions about the broader implications of international influences on consumption trends and their evolution in Brazil.
